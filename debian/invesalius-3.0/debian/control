Description: InVesalius: 3D medical imaging reconstruction software
 InVesalius generates 3D medical imaging reconstructions based on a sequence of 2D DICOM files acquired with CT or MRI equipments.  InVesalius is internationalized (currently available in English, Portuguese, French and Spanish), multi-platform (GNU Linux, Windows and MacOS) and provides several tools:
  * DICOM-support including: (a) ACR-NEMA version 1 and 2; (b) DICOM version 3.0 (including various encodings of JPEG -lossless and lossy-, RLE)
  * Image manipulation facilities (zoom, pan, rotation, brightness/contrast, etc)
  * Segmentation based on 2D slices
  * Pre-defined threshold ranges according to tissue of interest
  * Edition tools (similar to Paint Brush) based on 2D slices
  * 3D surface creation
  * 3D surface connectivity tools 
  * 3D surface exportation (including: binary STL, OBJ, VRML, Inventor)
  * High-quality volume rendering projection
  * Pre-defined volume rendering presets
  * Volume rendering crop plane
  * Picture exportation (including: BMP, TIFF, JPG, PostScript, POV-Ray)
